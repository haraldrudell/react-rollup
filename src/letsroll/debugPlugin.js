/*
  Type: Function
  Signature: ( id ) => (code | { code, map } | Promise)

  Defines a custom loader. Returning null defers to other load functions (and eventually the default behavior of loading from the file system).

  outro(){}

  Type: String|Function

  A String, or a Function that returns a String or Promise.

  renderChunk(){}


  Can be used to transform individual chunks. Called for each Rollup output chunk file. Returning null will apply no transformations.

  renderError

  Type: Function
  Signature: ( error ) => void

  Called when rollup encounters an error during bundle.generate() or bundle.write(). The error is passed to this hook. To get notified when generation completes successfully, use the generateBundle hook.

  renderStart(){}

  Type: Function
  Signature: ( ) => (void|Promise)

  Called initially each time bundle.generate() or bundle.write() is called. To get notified when generation has completed, use the generateBundle and renderError hooks.

  resolveId

  Type: Function
  Signature: ( importee, importer ) => (id|Promise)

  Defines a custom resolver. A resolver loader can be useful for e.g. locating third-party dependencies. Returning null or undefined defers to other resolveId functions (and eventually the default resolution behavior); returning false signals that importee should be treated as an external module and not included in the bundle.

  transform

  Type: Function
  Signature: ( source, id ) => (code|{ code, map }|Promise)

  Can be used to transform individual modules.

  watchChange

  Type: Function
  Signature: (file) => { }

  Notifies a plugin
}
